# !BONUS Question BONUS!
Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer
I think functions like `happyBirthdayPet()` and `funTypes()` have more specific requirements and uses specific methods, while `measureRain()` and `rounder()` have less strict requirements.
